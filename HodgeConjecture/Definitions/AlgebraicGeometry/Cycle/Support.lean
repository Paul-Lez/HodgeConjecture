# Geometric support of algebraic cycles

An algebraic cycle in Mathlib is indexed by the generic points of its irreducible components.
This file constructs the reduced integral closed subscheme attached to such a point and the
corresponding closed subset of complex points. It also constructs the geometric support of a
whole cycle as the union of the closures of the generic points with nonzero coefficient.
